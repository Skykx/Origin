#(mean we predict a binary output (0 or 1)), the loss 'loss' function always has to be 'binary_crossentropy')
# if we would do a categorical or non-binary classification, we would have to use "loss = categorical_crossentropy".
# + take notice that than the output layer is not "sigmoid"-function anymore, but instead it would have to be "softmax"-funtion

# Training the ANN on the Training set

# Part 4 - Making the predictions and evaluating the model
"""
**Important note 1:** Notice that the values of the features were all input in a double pair of square brackets. That's because the "predict" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.
**Important note 2:** Notice also that the "France" country was not input as a string in the last column but as "1, 0, 0" in the first three columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the one-hot-encoded values of the state, and as we see in the first row of the matrix of features X, 
"France" was encoded as "1, 0, 0". And be careful to include these values in the first three columns, because the dummy variables are always created in the first columns.
